Git is a version control system.
We manage snapshots for our each code. A snapshot represents the the current state of the code in our repo.
We do not need to remember the each line of code. Just use different versions of code and each snapshot helps us.

Commands :
=> git clone (Clones the repository from the remote link)
=> git add (It add files inside the staging area and with the particular file name 
    we can add that file to the staging area. When we commit i.ie take the snapshot then it,
    will commit only that file or changes.)
=> git commit -m "Your Commit Message" (Add the staging untracked part to the local repository
    )
